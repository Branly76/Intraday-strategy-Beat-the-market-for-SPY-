# Intraday-strategy-Beat-the-market-for-SPY-

I found this strategy at the following link: https://www.concretumgroup.com/backtesting-7-years-of-free-data-beat-the-market-an-effective-intraday-momentum-strategy-for-the-sp500-etf-spy/#Step-1
All rights belong to the "concretum group".

It looks a pretty good strategy, so i copied the code from the link. The data you need to download from Alpaca.
First you need  to subscribe and then you can create the needed keys for downloading the data.
In the data folder you will find the SPY data for the last 3 years, which means for tesing the software(process.py) you do not need to download the data anymore

Below you will find the results.
